\title{Calculate Z-Score from P-Value}
\usage{
calculate_z_score_from_p(p)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Numeric vector of two-tailed p-values (between 0 and 1)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of absolute Z-scores
}
\description{
Calculates the Z-score corresponding to a two-tailed p-value using:
Z = qnorm(1 - (p / 2))
}
\details{
Note: This returns the absolute value of the Z-score. For directional
effects, use the sign from the original effect size.

This function converts p-values back to their corresponding Z-scores
assuming a standard normal distribution. The result is always positive
(absolute value) since p-values don't contain directional information.

\strong{Requirements:}
\itemize{
\item \code{p} values must be between 0 and 1 (exclusive for meaningful Z-scores)
}

\strong{Edge cases:}
\itemize{
\item p = 0 returns Inf (infinite Z-score)
\item p = 1 returns 0 (no evidence against null)
\item Very small p-values may produce very large Z-scores
}
}
\examples{
# Single p-value
calculate_z_score_from_p(p = 0.05)

# Multiple p-values
calculate_z_score_from_p(p = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1))
